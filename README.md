# RAILS BUDGETY APP

The Ruby on Rails capstone project is about building a mobile web application where I can manage my budget: I have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that I can see how much money I spent and on what.

I will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:

- register and log in, so that the data is private to them.
- introduce new transactions associated with a category.
- see the money spent on each category.
